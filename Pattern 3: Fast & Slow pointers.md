## Pattern 3: Fast & Slow pointers

The <b>Fast & Slow</b> pointer approach, also known as the <b>Hare & Tortoise algorithm</b>, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this technique was <b>Finding a cycle in a LinkedList</b>. Letâ€™s jump onto this problem to understand the <b>Fast & Slow</b> pattern.
