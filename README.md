- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.

# Depth First Search (DFS)

This pattern is based on the Depth First Search (DFS) technique to traverse a tree.

We will be using recursion (or we can also use a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be `O(H)`, where `â€˜Hâ€™` is the maximum height of the tree.
