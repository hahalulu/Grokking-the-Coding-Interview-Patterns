# Grokking the Coding Interview in 16 Patterns

## Pattern 1: Sliding Window

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. For example, take a look at this problem:

> Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.

The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each contiguous subarray as a sliding window of `‘5’` elements. This means that we will slide the window by one element when we move on to the next subarray. To reuse the sum from the previous subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window and add the element now being included in the sliding window. This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to `O(N)`.

## Pattern 2: Two Pointer

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray. For example, take a look at the following problem:

> Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

To solve this problem, we can consider each element one by one (pointed out by the first pointer) and iterate through the remaining elements (pointed out by the second pointer) to find a pair with the given sum. The time complexity of this algorithm will be `O(N^2)` where `‘N’` is the number of elements in the input array.

Given that the input array is sorted, an efficient way would be to start with one pointer in the beginning and another pointer at the end. At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the two pointers add up to the target sum. If they do not, we will do one of two things:
1. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is greater than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can decrement the end-pointer.
2. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is smaller than the target sum, this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can increment the start-pointer.

## Pattern 3: Fast & Slow pointers

## Pattern 4: Merge Intervals

## Pattern 5: Cyclic Sort

## Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList

## Pattern 7: Tree Breadth First Search

## Pattern 8: Depth First Search (DFS)

This pattern is based on the <b>Depth First Search (DFS)</b> technique to traverse a tree.

We will be using recursion (or we can also use a stack for the iterative approach) to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be `O(H)`, where `‘H’` is the maximum height of the tree.

## Pattern 9: Two Heaps

## Pattern 10: Subsets

## Pattern 11: Modified Binary Search

## Pattern 12: Bitwise XOR

## Pattern 13: Top 'K' Elements

Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent ‘K’ elements among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of ‘K’ elements is Heap. This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given elements.

## Pattern 14: K-way merge

## Pattern 15: 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)

## Pattern 16: Topological Sort (Graph)
