# Pattern 4 : Merge Intervals

## Merge Intervals (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/

> Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Our goal is to merge the intervals whenever they overlap. 
The diagram above clearly shows a merging approach. Our algorithm will look like this:

1. Sort the intervals on the start time to ensure `a.start <= b.start`
2. If `a` overlaps `b` (i.e. `b.start <= a.end`), we need to merge them into a new interval `c` such that:
````
    c.start = a.start
    c.end = max(a.end, b.end)
````
We will keep repeating the above two steps to merge `c` with the next interval if it overlaps with `c`.

````
class Interval {
  constructor(start, end) {
    this.start = start;
    this.end = end;
  }

  get_interval() {
    return "[" + this.start + ", " + this.end + "]";
  }
}

function merge (intervals) {
  if(intervals.length < 2) {
    return intervals
  }
  
  //sort the intervals on the start time
  intervals.sort((a,b) => a.start - b.start
                )
  const mergedIntervals = []
  
  let start = intervals[0].start
  let end = intervals[0].end
  
  for(let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const interval = intervals[i]
    if(interval.start <= end) {
      //overlapping intervals, adjust the end
      end = Math.max(interval.end, end)    
    } else {
      //non-overlapping intercal, add the precious interval and reset
      mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
      start = interval.start
      end = interval.end
    }
  }
  //add the last interval
  mergedIntervals.push(new Interval(start, end))
  return mergedIntervals;
};

merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 5), new Interval(7, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
//Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into one [1,5].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(6, 7), new Interval(2, 4), new Interval(5, 9)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
//Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].


merged_intervals = merge([new Interval(1, 4), new Interval(2, 6), new Interval(3, 5)]);
result = "";
for(i=0; i < merged_intervals.length; i++) {
  result += merged_intervals[i].get_interval() + " ";
}
console.log(`Merged intervals: ${result}`)
//Output: [[1,6]]
//Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N * logN)`, where `N` is the total number of intervals. We are iterating the intervals only once which will take `O(N)`, in the beginning though, since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take `O(N * logN)`.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals. We will also need `O(N)` space for sorting

>  Given a set of intervals, find out if any two intervals overlap.

 We can follow the same approach as discussed above to find if any two intervals overlap.
